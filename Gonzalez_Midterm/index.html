            <p class="ForYou_Text"> The reason why this website was created is to help you. With COVID-19 information being thrown out all over the internet, finding information can be very stressful. This website is meant to contain most of the information you need in order to find a location where you can be tested for COVID-19 or if you need to find a location to get the 
            COVID-19 vaccine. My goal is keep updating this website to the most recent information. </p>
